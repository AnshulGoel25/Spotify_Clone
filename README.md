# Spotify_Clone
Spotify clone using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
Creating a Spotify clone is a challenging and ambitious project from a technical and legal standpoint. While building a music streaming service like Spotify may be a great learning experience, there are several important considerations to keep in mind:

Legal Implications: Building a clone of an existing commercial product like Spotify may raise copyright and intellectual property issues. Using copyrighted material, including music, without proper licensing or permission is illegal and can lead to serious consequences. Ensure you have the necessary licenses or use royalty-free music for testing.

APIs and Data: Accessing and using Spotify's official APIs or any other third-party APIs requires adhering to their terms of use and guidelines. Make sure you comply with their policies to avoid any legal issues.

Scalability and Performance: A music streaming service like Spotify deals with massive data and requires robust infrastructure to handle concurrent users, streaming, and database operations. Ensuring scalability and optimal performance can be complex and resource-intensive.
This is the style.css file for the clone website. It imports the Poppins and Roboto fonts, sets the default margin and padding to 0, and defines the primary, secondary, and accent colors. The body font is set to Poppins, and the h1, h2, and h3 headings are set to different font sizes. The p element is set to use the Roboto font, a smaller font size, and secondary text color. An element is set to have no text decoration and display as an inline-block. The .small-bold-text class is used to style text with a smaller font size and bold weight.
